      <!-- //  ABOUT ME  // -->
      <main>
        <!-- Start content edits below this line. -->
        <p>Hi my name is Yanheng and I was was born in China and immigrated with my parents to America when I was four years old and grew up juggling my Chinese culture and this new American culture. Amidst all my childhood internal battles, I discovered the beauty of art in Anime and specifically Yu-gi-oh! trading card’s Art. As a kid, I loved everything action related from sci-fi movies to online videogames to Shonen Jump manga. I started out by making drawings and imitations of my favorite characters and loved it. Though it’s been a long time since, I still haven’t forgotten my first love with art.

          ​
          
          I am currently a student at San Jose State University and majoring in Digital Media Art in order to get my BFA. I am also a part of the DMA Cadre Club as a club member learning about other people’s art and their experiences. I mainly work digitally on my computer and love video editing, digital illustration and 3-D modeling and have experience in a number of different software including: Autodesk Maya, Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, Premiere Pro, Capcut, and Krita. My passion for video editing was inspired during the pandemic when I saw the rise of TikTok and other forms of short form content and the importance grabbing a viewer’s attention which is where great editing shines. This tipped my interests and I started experimenting. As I expanded my horizons into maya, and adobe apps I began to be more interested in other ways of art creation. As I continue to grow as an artist and as a student, I plan on expanding my skill sets as much as possible to be a jack of all trades and an experienced and fast learner.
          
          ​
          
          It is my dream to one day become a guy that can just sit at his computer desk with creating beautiful renders and working on my passion..</p>
